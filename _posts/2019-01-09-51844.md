<p>下記のサイトを参考にdocker build .をしたいのですがうまくいきません<br>
<a href="https://engineering.adwerx.com/rails-on-kubernetes-8cd4940eacbe" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://engineering.adwerx.com/rails-on-kubernetes-8cd4940eacbe</a></p>

<p>最初は<br>
app.conf <br>
config.ru <br>
Dockerfile <br>
env.conf <br>
Gemfile <br>
Gemfile.lock <br>
Rakefile <br>
を作り、<code>docker build .</code>を実行したところ下記エラーが出ました。</p>

```
rake aborted! Do not know how to build task 'assets: precompile'
　(See full trace by running task with - trace) The command '/ bin / sh -c bundle 　exec rake ass

ets: precompile' returned a non-zero code: 1 I got an error　saying.
```

<p>次に<br>
<a href="https://github.com/jbielick/rails-kube-demo" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/jbielick/rails-kube-demo</a> を<code>git clone</code>したのですが<br>
下記エラーがでました。</p>

```
