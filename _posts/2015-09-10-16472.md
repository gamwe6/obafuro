<p>I created HTML5 animation by Google Swiffy.<br>
And tryed displaying on Browser with Samsung GalaxyS3(Android4.0) and other Galaxy series, but it was not displayed.<br>
There was no problem in the other devices. (iPhone, other Android4.0)</p>

<p>This problem has occurred from Google Swiffy version7.3.<br>
Do people have to worry about the same phenomenon?<br>
Galaxy series not support HTML5 created by new Google Swiffy?</p>
