title: "線形計画問題をscipy.optimizationで解こうとすると失敗する"

<p>以下の制約付き線形計画問題を解こうとしています。</p>

<pre><code>min A*x
s.t.
Ceq*x-Deq=0
Cineq*x-Dineq&gt;=0
</code></pre>

<p>今回、罰金法を使って制約なし問題に変換して解いています。<br>
しかし以下のコードを実行すると、"Linear search failed"というエラーが出て最適化に失敗します。L-BFGS-BとTNCを試しましたが、両方ダメでした。線形計画問題なのでソルバで解けるはずで、何か初歩的なミスをしていると思うのですが、何がいけないのでしょうか？どうしたら最適化できますか？<br>
将来非線形問題に拡張しようと思っているので、できれば非線形のソルバを使いたいです。<br>
よろしくお願いします。</p>
